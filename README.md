The Auro ORM Engine is a Rust-based engine designed exclusively for internal use within our organization. It enhances Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) functionality in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, providing seamless integration with PostgreSQL databases.

## 🚀 Features

- **Rust-Powered**: Leveraging the performance and safety features of Rust, the Auro ORM Engine enhances our JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

- **ORM Compatibility**: Designed to complement our existing ORM solutions, this engine extends our ORM's capabilities for PostgreSQL database interactions.

- **PostgreSQL Support**: Provides specialized support for PostgreSQL as the primary database backend.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [aws_sdk_rdsdata](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-rdsdata/latest/aws_sdk_rdsdata/) for the library they made because without it, it would be a lot harder to make this one. We also extend our gratitude to the Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL communities for their continuous contributions and support.
